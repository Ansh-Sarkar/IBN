# Interface Blockchain Network ( IBN )
This project was originally made as a part of the SHAGUN project which we were working on so as to facilitate proper
encoding and security of transactions and also maintaining a permanant record of the posts and transactions on the 
Matic BlockChain Network using the [Moibit API](https://www.moibit.io/) .
